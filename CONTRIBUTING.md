# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our data gathering app! Your contributions enhance the recording of local weather data, ultimately helping communities better prepare for and respond to flooding events.

## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project:** Understand the project's structure, coding conventions, and contribution guidelines. Identify areas where you can contribute, such as fixing bugs, adding features, or improving existing code.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:** Ensure you have Flutter installed and set up on your machine. You'll also need a code editor and Git installed. Android Studio and VS Code allow Android Emulators for checking whether the application runs properly.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository of the Flutter application.

        git clone https://github.com/COS-IT-FLOWS/Gather.git

4. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes to keep your work isolated from the main codebase.

        git checkout -b feature-branch

5. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes in the codebase. This could involve fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing functionality. Follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

6. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes work as expected and do not introduce any new issues. Run tests that are available in the project.

7. **Update Documentation:** If your changes impact the user interface, functionality, or API, update the documentation to reflect these changes.

8. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch.

        git add .
        git commit -m "Add feature X"

9. **Push Your Changes**: Push your branch to the remote repository.

        git push origin feature-branch

10. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the project. Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.

11. **Review and Collaborate**: Participate in the review process by responding to feedback and making necessary revisions to your code.

12. **Merge Your Changes:** Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase, and your contributions will be part of the project.
